## About me
1. My name is L.
2. I'm a coding beginner with experience/muscle memory. I started teaching myself python when I was 8, which I gave up on pretty quickly. I also did an internship summer 2022 where I coded a website using Java, CSS, HTML, and python, but I don't remember any commands. I know what the languages do, but not the commands.
3. I hope to pass this course and not give up becsuse I got frustrated.
4. The best thing I ate this summer was some leftovers my mom brought home from a BBQ in the bronx.
