# P5 Sketch Reflection

I was nervous going into the sketch, because I haven't used code to draw in a while. Then I was even more nervous when I saw criteria that was not mentioned in the drawing sketch appear in the final sketch assignment, so I had to think of a completely new idea on the fly. I also didn't know how to change the fill and stroke color for new shapes, because in my first sketch the fill and stroke would apply to every shape that I drew, so I ahd to look it up, but I understand how it works now. I'm proud of myself for challenging myself to use a 2D primitive that used more coordinates than I understood, the curve.  

I can't upload any photos to github for some reason.
