##### Reflection 

```
1. You cant clearly tell what it is that I was trying to do, because I did a lot of editing, adding and renaming, but I have a clear development.
2. The names of my commits are exactly what I was doing, and although short, they clearly convey exactly what I did.
3. I've definitely recently implemented a system where I put detailed titles or descriptions of whatever it is that I'm writing, which is helpful for my organization.
```
